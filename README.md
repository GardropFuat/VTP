Video Tag Portal (2012-13)

Proposed/Advised by: Nick Newell

Sponsored by: Echostar Systems

Project Description:  
The amount of video content being generated, shared, and consumed is increasing exponentially by the day.  However, there doesn’t seem to be a good way to flexibly associate user-generated tags with the real-time video to create a social video experience.  For example, there is no way to tag your friend, Frank, at the 23 second mark of your Facebook video as he does a handstand on top of Mt. Elbert and then make a comment on his handstand technique.  There is also no way to associate a still photo of Frank doing the handstand so that it pops up next to the video in real-time when the video hits 23 seconds in.  We lack one place online where everyone can go to watch any video and then make their personal contribution so that subsequent viewers can enjoy a social video experience together.  This exists in many forms for still images and is extremely popular.  Let’s create that place for moving images.
